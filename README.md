# Landing Page Exercise

This repository is for the landing page exercise in the Odin Project
Here I will be practicing basic HTML and CSS to recreate the landing page example given to me in the OP cirriculum.
I will also use this project as practice for setting up git, github, cloning, adding, and committing 
  -Thus far, GitHub has been confusing for me so I hope to become more familiar with the process as I progress through the exercise.
  - A note for myself - remember to git add / git push frequently and add messages (-m) for practice and to check the updates on GitHub to ensure the         changes were added properly.
